339	            Evaluation Consultant	        United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)	New York, NY	jl_1c3e6b335b81b1b0	6 days ago	1c3e6b335b81b1b0	https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=1c3e6b335b81b1b0	The UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women (UNTF) is a global multi-lateral grant making mechanism supporting national efforts to prevent and end violence against women and girls. The UN Trust Fund was established through the UN General Assembly Resolution 50/166 in 1996 with UN Women as its Administrator on behalf of the UN system. The UN Trust Fund provides grants to advance the development of innovative models and strategic interventions in the area of ending violence against women and girls (EVAW/G). Grantees – comprising of non-governmental organizations - have engaged diverse actors, such as women’s, men’s, adolescents and youth groups, indigenous communities, religious and traditional leaders, human rights organizations and the media. To date, the UN Trust Fund has awarded - US$ 140 million to 493 initiatives in 139 countries/territories.In 2015 the UN Trust Fund developed a new five-year (2015-2020) strategic plan with the mission to “advocate for and finance innovative approaches for preventing and ending violence against women and girls, to catalyze learning from global evidence collected from the programmes funded by the UNTF and to leverage its unique mandate and convening power to foster global giving to end violence against women and girls”. It will achieve this mission through three inter-connected pillars of work:Grant giving to initiatives to end violence against women and girls;Building a global Evidence Hub on ending violence against women and girls based on the evaluated results of UNTF grantees; andAdvocating for global giving for work on ending violence against women and girls.This assignment is intended to support the second pillar: the development of an evidence hub. In 2016, the UN Trust Fund’s Call for Proposals (Cycle 20) specified that final, external evaluations would be centralized for projects implemented by small organizations receiving small grants (under $150,000). This decision was put in place following a meta-evaluation of the quality of final, external evaluations which found that small organizations receiving small grants were not able to budget sufficient resources for quality evaluations. Therefore, the UN Trust Fund will systematically plan and manage evaluations of small grants from the Secretariat in New York in partnership with grantee organizations. This presents an opportunity to build upon existing capacity development activities for grantees and move toward a coaching relationship with evaluation task mangers from small CSOs. This will inform the UN Trust Fund’s broader support for small women’s organizations in the field of EVAW. In addition, evaluation remains mandatory for all other projects funded by the UNTF. The UNTF will continue supporting all other organizations receiving grants, to plan and manage their own evaluations through quality assurance, guidance and support. Lessons learned from the above will inform improvements to the UNTF’s guidance, policies and procedures on evaluation.Twenty-one projects will be due for an evaluation or preparing for an evaluation in 2019-2020 and therefore the UN Trust Fund needs an evaluation consultant (with experience in ending violence against women and support to small CSOs) to support the UN Trust Fund’s activities under the small grants evaluation procedure and support the QA and oversight process for all other grantees.

Individuals with a PhD in science or engineering and interests in modeling and assessing the prospective evolution to mid-century of U.S. electricity markets and grids are encouraged to apply.The individual will join Rapid Switch, a new international multi-disciplinary collaboration, currently including researchers in the U.S., China, India, and Australia. The network of researchers seeks to identify pathways to accelerate decarbonization of energy systems by assessing bottlenecks, barriers and resistive forces. Factors that can retard the pace of transition are diverse in nature, including industrial bottlenecks (technological challenges, natural resource availability and constraints in material supplies and manufacturing capacity), regulatory limitations, economic forces and fiscal constraints, political constraints and goal, collective action problems, consumer preferences and fears, lack of public acceptance, rational and irrational influences on public and private investment decisions, and others.One focus of Rapid Switch is electricity systems, with parallel case-study analyses for India and the U.S. to help understand the pace and extent to which variable renewable electricity generation (wind, solar) is likely to be able to contribute to future electricity supplies. Technological and institutional innovation are likely to be critical; understanding just how fast new technologies or electricity market designs can be developed and deployed, for example, is critical to framing expectations for how rapidly the electricity sector can decarbonize.PhD degree in a relevant science or engineering field is required. Applicants should possess strong, demonstrated electricity market and grid modelling and analysis skills. Experience with algebraic modeling languages used for linear programming (e.g. AMPL, GAMS, etc.) and mixed integer nonlinear optimization is required. Familiarity with commercial grid modeling software (e.g., Aurora or Plexos) is desirable. Candidates should also enjoy interdisciplinary research and be comfortable interacting with social scientists assessing non-technological factors that may inhibit the pace of U.S. grid decarbonization and with Rapid Switch collaborators conducting grid-related assessments for India. Candidates must have excellent English written and spoken communication skills.The appointment will be for one year, with possibility of renewal based on performance and funding.Applicants must apply online at https://www.princeton.edu/acad-positions/position/9845 and submit a CV, cover letter, and contact information for three references. This position is subject to the University's background check policy.

The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins. In 2018, BP completed a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's world-class unconventional oil and gas assets in the Permian-Delaware basin in Texas, along with two premium positions in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins in Texas and Louisiana. These assets currently produce 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 45 percent are liquid hydrocarbons. The deal represents BP’s largest purchase since buying ARCO in 1999. It is a transformational acquisition for our BPX Energy business which gives the BPX Energy team access to some of the best acreage in some of the best basins in the onshore U.S.

1896	            Postdoctoral Position - Mitochondrial Signaling - Brand lab	        Buck Institute for Research on Aging	Novato, CA	jl_c2687aa97a784d85	30+ days ago	c2687aa97a784d85	https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c2687aa97a784d85	PROJECT SUMMARY:A postdoctoral position is available immediately in mitochondrial signaling in type 2 diabetes (T2D) at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Novato, California (San Francisco Bay Area).This is a full time position with an initial one-year contract that can be extended.The project uses pancreatic β-cell physiology assaying and top-down analysis of bioenergetic parameters measured using fluorescence microscopy and Seahorse respirometry to uncover causes of beta cell failure in T2D. Therefore both strong wet-bench and data analysis skills are required.PROJECT OVERVIEW:Altered cellular energetics and related cellular signaling contribute to human disease in general and physiological aging and chronic diseases in particular, including cancer, neurodegeneration, ischemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial metabolism also plays a central role in insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. When glucose is elevated, the increased metabolism results in a substantial mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, as well as in increased rates of ATP synthesis and turnover marked by faster cell respiration. The project uses microscale bioenergetic assaying of human primary β-cell cultures, assessment of β-cell physiology and top-down analysis of cellular energy metabolism. The project investigates the molecular pathways that make healthy β- cell bioenergetics – and insulin secretion – normally highly responsive to glucose, and pathways that may fail in type 2 diabetes. Relevant papers from our lab to this project are: PMIDs 26204464, 27404273, 27771512.The successful candidate will receive training in the particular experimental technologies used in this project, will design and conduct experiments and analyze data. The postdoc is expected to lead his/her own project, write up and present results.ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS:PhD in biological or biomedical sciences, bioengineering or bioinformaticsSolid knowledge of cell and mitochondrial metabolismCell culturing experienceWet bench experienceProven publication recordStrong written and oral communication skillsAbility to prioritize and manage own timeAbility to work independently and also capable of interacting successfully within a group.DESIRED SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE:Cell or mitochondrial respirometryFluorescence microscopyExperience in β-cell physiology or in diabetesExperience in metabolic modelingExperience in RNAi methodsBUCK INSTITUTE ENVIRONMENT:The Buck Institute for Research on Aging consists of state-of-the-art research laboratories with faculty recruited from four different disciplines — diseases of aging, processes of aging, stem cell biology, and technology for aging studies.

WWF has worked in Markets and Food for over a decade with the acknowledgement that the biggest threat to our mission has long been where and how we produce food. Now those impacts are being exacerbated by increased populations, increasing income, shifts in consumption patterns, and climate change.This internship provides an opportunity for a graduate student with expertise in supply chain logistics to contribute to research at the intersection of environmental and financial sustainability. WWF is examining the indoor and vertical soil-less farming industry. At scale, this method of farming could reduce pressures on land, biodiversity, natural habitat, and climate, but to get there it has to overcome several key hurdles that prevent it from moving beyond its current specialization in high-end leafy greens. We want to help farms overcome those hurdles, such as ones related to energy and labor, and move the industry forward. Before we can do that, we need to better understand the current baseline and environmental drivers. This internship will be part of a small team working to conduct a life-cycle analysis of current systems (hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics, in greenhouse or vertical settings), allowing us to establish a baseline for GHG and carbon emissions, water use, pesticides, fertilizer/nutrients, land, and costs.This internship is flexible on location and can start in early September 2019 or sooner.ResponsibilitiesInternship Description:Specific duties will include:Identify gaps in life cycle inventory data for six pre-selected alternative agriculture systems and research to fill using academic literature or raw dataPerform modeling and analysis using SimaPro software for the six alternative systems and compare against conventional agricultureAssist with drafting a written LCA report presenting findings of analysisQualificationsMinimum Requirements:Graduate or PhD student with expertise in supply chain logisticsExperience conducting life cycle analysesPrevious experience using SimaPro software preferredExperience with indoor or vertical farms a plusPart-time or full-timeExcellent research, writing, and analytical skills, as well as attention to detailAbility to work productively on both independent research assignments and as part of a teamProactive problem-solving and effective communication skills (written and verbal)Location:Washington, DC or remoteCompensation:PaidHow to apply: Please submit a resume & cover letter through our Careers page.https://careers-wwfus.icims.com/jobs/search , IN-20001Please note that WWF does not provide VISA sponsorship to internsAs an EOE/AA employer, WWF will not discriminate in its employment practices due to an applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, or protected Veteran status.

2316	            Air Quality Engineer (Whittier)	        Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County	Whittier, CA	jl_c70bd0e1d973c23f	30+ days ago	c70bd0e1d973c23f	https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c70bd0e1d973c23f	"JOB POSTINGNOTICE OF EXTERNAL RECRUITMENTSELECTION #RQ-109-19 The Sanitation Districts function on a regional scale and consist of 24 independent special districts serving approximately 5.6 million people in Los Angeles County. The service area covers approximately 824 square miles and encompasses 78 cities and unincorporated territory within the county. The Sanitation Districts were created in 1923 when a significant number of cities were forming and it was clear that managing wastewater on a regional scale made sense. The Sanitation Districts' purpose was to construct, operate, and maintain facilities that collect, treat, recycle, and dispose of domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater. Individual districts operate and maintain the Sanitation District-owned collection systems. Cities and unincorporated areas within the district are responsible for their smaller local collection systems. Cities and unincorporated parts of the county are also responsible for the collection of solid waste. In the 1950s, it became apparent that solid waste management would benefit from a regional approach. At that time, the Sanitation Districts were given the responsibility to provide for the management of collected solid waste, including disposal and transfer operations, and materials and energy recovery. To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, the 24 Sanitation Districts work cooperatively under a Joint Administration Agreement with one administrative staff headquartered near the City of Whittier. Each Sanitation District has a Board of Directors, consisting of the mayor of each city and the Chair of the County Board of Supervisors for unincorporated territory. Each Sanitation District pays its proportionate share of joint administrative costs. Approximately 1,400 miles of sewers, 48 active pumping plants, and 11 wastewater treatment plants convey and treat over half the wastewater in Los Angeles County. The Sanitation Districts' solid waste management sites similarly provide about one-fourth of the countywide solid waste management needs. The Sanitation Districts operate two sanitary landfills, three landfill energy recovery facilities, one recycle center, and three materials recovery/transfer facilities, and participate in the operation of two refuse-to- energy facilities. The Sanitation Districts are innovators in the production of green energy and water recycling. Approximately 120 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply the needs of about 120,000 homes, are created in the Sanitation Districts' wastewater and solid waste operations. Sanitation Districts' water reclamation plants produce approximately 150 million gallons per day of recycled water that can be safely used for irrigation and other uses. The majority of this recycled water is beneficially reused and is enough to replace the water used by over 500,000 Southern California families.ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS: The incumbent will perform work involving air quality engineering, focusing on regulatory compliance and enforcement. Specific areas of work may include: preparing regulatory permit applications (along with supporting work such as air dispersion modeling and health risk assessment preparation), regulatory correspondence, issue analysis memoranda and technical reports; developing qualification criteria, scope of work, and contractual language for retaining engineering consultants and emissions testing firms; representing the Sanitation Districts at public hearings and meetings with regulatory staff, elected officials and coalition members; supporting field operations; and performing other duties as required.MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONSApplicants must possess a valid California Class C driver license -AND- Option A: A bachelor's degree and master's degree both in a pertinent engineering discipline from an accredited and recognized college or university; Option B: A bachelor's degree from an accredited and recognized college or university in a related science with an Engineer-In-Training Certificate and a master's degree from an accredited and recognized college or university in a pertinent engineering discipline; Option C: Two years of professional engineering experience subsequent to earning a bachelor's degree in engineering from an accredited and recognized college or university.DESIRABLE QUALIFICATIONS: Completion of 12 units of upper division/graduate level air quality, wastewater and solid waste management related courses AND two years of air quality related experience is desirable.

The position will support the GCF Task Force’s partnership with The Climate Group through the MRV and Pathways grant provided by NICFI through March 2021. The GCF Task Force states and provinces which will participate in the project are Quintana Roo, Mexico; Loreto, Peru; and Amazonas and Mato Grosso, Brazil.In early 2019 an organization will be contracted by The Climate Group to provide MRV and pathway support for selected states and provinces. The Technical Manager will collaborate closely with the contracted organization (CO), GCF Task Force Secretariat (including country coordinators), The Climate Group, and GCF Task Force delegates to provide overall technical oversight and management related to MRV and Pathway planning for the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. The position will expose the incumbent to technical modelling methods and approaches, but also requires program management and administration skillsThe Program Officer will be responsible for ensuring pathway and MRV support translates to meaningful and practical results by developing an understanding of the current realities in each jurisdiction and ensuring support is delivered in a manner that is reflective of their policies, programs, and capacities. The Program Officer will also be responsible for using lessons learned from the project to develop an approach for AFOLU pathway modelling that can be adapted and scaled across the GCF network.A decarbonization pathway begins with a government’s long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goal, and then works backwards to identify the technologies, infrastructure and investments that will be required to achieve it. In collaboration with government agencies, the process helps policymakers set intermediate milestones that must be achieved to reach the long-term decarbonization vision, and better understand the costs, risks, trade-offs and co-benefits associated with different policy approaches. The result is a series of tailored options that explore the potential pace at which emission reductions can be achieved, and their social and economic implications within the jurisdiction.Who We AreThe GCF is a project of the University of Colorado, Boulder’s Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) and the Laboratory for Energy & Environmental Policy innovation (LEEP). The GCF Task Force is a unique collaboration among 38 states and provinces in ten mainly tropical forest countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, Ecuador, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the United States) that seeks to advance subnational leadership and jurisdictional approaches to forest protection and low emissions development.GCF Task Force states and provinces encompass more than one-third of the world’s tropical forests, including the entire Brazilian Amazon, over 85% of the Peruvian Amazon, and more than half of Indonesia’s forests. For more information, see www.gcftaskforce.org.In 2017, the GCF Task Force entered into a strategic partnership with The Climate Group (TCG) which serves as the secretariat for the Under2Coalition. The Under2Coalition is comprised of more than 220 governments, 28 of which are also GCF Task Force members, which have committed to keeping global temperature rise to well below 2°C. The Under2 Coalition secured a grant from Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), to support governments in emerging economies to track emissions and plan pathways to achieve their climate targets. The Climate Group, as Secretariat of the Under2 Coalition, is partnering with the GCF as a primary knowledge partner on tropical forests and land use for this project to help GCF regions build Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems and long-term, 2050 deep decarbonization pathways’ analysis (pathways analysis).What Your Key Responsibilities Will BeAct as the primary technical liaison between the GCF Task Force Secretariat, The Climate Group and the CO for MRV and pathways support related to AFOLU.Lead program management and reporting in collaboration with Senior Program Officer and Project Administrator.Maintain and enhance the GCF Task Force Knowledge Database.Establish relationships with relevant stakeholders including: GCF Task Force Delegates, GCF Task Force country coordinators, in-country civil society partners, national governments, representatives from indigenous peoples/local community organizations, external technical experts, and stakeholders from other relevant initiative.Work with CO, GCF Task Force Secretariat and in-country coordinators to identify and promote best practices in MRV and pathway modeling and support capacity building workshops in selected jurisdiction.Assess and track ongoing support provided to GCF Task Force jurisdictions through our partnership with UNDP to ensure pathway planning and MRV support is complimentary to existing initiativesProvide technical backstop support, guidance, quality assurance and quality control to ensure consistency and rigor among MRV and Pathway activities throughout GCF Task Force jurisdictions.Provide guidance and support to ensure pathway planning processes go through appropriate and sufficient consultation and feedback processes at the local level to ensure local relevance, ownership and buy-inWork with GCF delegates and in-country partners to assess implications of different pathway scenarios and provide support to select most appropriate options.Distill information from pathway and MRV activities and disseminate to a diverse range of stakeholders, using terminology for lay-audiences when needed.Work with GCF delegates and in-country partners to determine how results from pathway and MRV support will be integrated into policy and regulatory frameworks.Integrate data collected through MRV and pathway support into the GCF Knowledge Database and other relevant platforms, such as the CDP States and Regions disclosure.Identify and develop opportunities for cross-jurisdictional exchanges to share progress and build capacity across the entire GCF Task Force network and the Under2Coalition.Using lesson learned a tool or approach for AFOLU pathway models to be adapted and scaled across other GCF Task Force jurisdictions.What You Should KnowThe University of Colorado Boulder conducts background checks on all final applicants being considered for employment, prior to the issuance of an offer letter.
